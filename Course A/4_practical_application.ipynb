    "# Working directly in Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, you have been experimenting and learning the basics from simple and locally created tables. This was indeed enough to get you started, but let's be honest: Not the fun you expected. From now on, you will be working directly from our data warehouse, ```Snowflake```. But, this also means that you will need to think about what you query and more importantly, how you do it. Indeed, some of the tables are massive as they contain every single event a player generated through their actions in the game. This means that queries can day days to execute, and if they do, it was probably not what you were looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, you will be interacting directly with a set of tables in Snowflake (specially created for this course to limit potential errors and to speed up getting results). Below is a list of exercices, but let's start by a quick intro to ```Snowflake```. \n"

    "Snowflake is a cloud-based data platform designed to handle large-scale data storage, processing, and analytics. It provides a fully managed, elastic architecture that allows users to easily scale their data storage and compute resources independently. Snowflake simplifies data management by integrating various data sources, offering real-time access to data through SQL queries, and enabling seamless collaboration between teams. It supports both structured and semi-structured data, making it a flexible solution for diverse data workloads. With its focus on performance, security, and ease of use, Snowflake helps organizations streamline their data operations and gain actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake is a powerful platform that simplifies SQL querying and allows users to run Python scripts and notebooks for data analysis. For those working primarily with SQL, Snowflake provides a fully managed environment where you can easily run complex queries on large datasets, leveraging its fast processing power and scalability. The platform supports standard SQL, so users can perform data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis with familiar commands. Additionally, Snowflake integrates well with Python, enabling you to use notebooks or scripts for more advanced data operations, machine learning, and automation. This makes it an ideal tool for users focused on querying and analyzing data, without needing to worry about infrastructure management."
