# DSQL, Python & NLP for User Research Team
## Introduction & Motivation

As the voice of the player inside Paradox Interactive, the User Research team plays a critical role in shaping our games. From surveys and user testing to review analysis and sentiment tracking, your work is essential to helping designers, producers, and leadership understand how players feel, behave, and respond to what we build.
But as the scale and complexity of our data grows, so too does the need to move beyond surface-level analysis.
This course path is designed to help you go deeper—to give you the tools, confidence, and practical skills to handle the data yourself, analyze it in new ways, and extract richer, more actionable insights. From structured survey data to unstructured open-ended feedback, from SQL queries to text analysis in Python, this training enables you to take control of the entire research pipeline.

You don’t need a technical background. You don’t need to be a developer. What you do need is the willingness to get hands-on with the data—because the tools are now accessible, and the value they offer is enormous.

By the end of this training, you’ll be able to:
* Extract structured and unstructured data directly using SQL
* Clean and transform data using Python and Pandas
* Perform statistical summaries and generate visualizations
* Analyze player sentiment using NLP libraries like VADER and TextBlob
* Generate word clouds, key phrase extractions, and theme clustering
* Present findings in compelling, evidence-based formats for game teams and stakeholders

This course is all about  interpreting, exploring, and surfacing insights that help game teams move forward with confidence. This training is not just a course—it’s an investment in your own capability and in the future of Paradox’s player-first development culture.

## Overview
## Course A: Essential SQL for User Researchers
The objective is to quickly get you up to speed with SQL basics so you can extract and manipulate data needed for research projects.
### Detailed Session Breakdown (4 Sessions)

#### Session 1: Databases 101
```Topics Covered```: Tables, rows, columns, ```SELECT```, ```WHERE```, ```LIMIT``` (<b>Duration</b>: 90 minutes)
* What is SQL, what is a database, and why it matters in research
* Table structure demo using example review dataset (columns, types, keys)
* Writing simple ```SELECT``` statements + ```WHERE``` filters
* Using ```LIMIT``` to preview small datasets
* Practice queries: Retrieve all reviews for a specific game.

#### Session 2: Aggregating & Filtering
```Topics Covered```: ```COUNT```, ```AVG```, ```GROUP BY```, ```HAVING``` (<b>Duration</b>: 90 minutes)
* Quick recap of ```SELECT/WHERE```
* Intro to ```COUNT```, ```AVG```, ```MIN```, ```MAX``` – use in reviewing player feedback
* ```GROUP BY```: Segmenting by region, platform, language
* ```HAVING```: Filtering aggregated results
* Mini-challenge: What games receive the most positive sentiment by region?


#### Session 3: Combining Data
```Topics Covered```: Understanding JOINs (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) (<b>Duration</b>: 90 minutes)
* Visual explanation of how JOINs work
* INNER JOIN: Link reviews to user segments
* LEFT JOIN: Ensure you keep full review list while joining metadata
* Practice exercise: Join review text with game and platform metadata


#### Session 4: Practical Application
```Topics Covered```: Real-world scenarios using reviews and structured data (<b>Duration</b>: 90 minutes)
* Recap key SQL patterns and joins
* Case Study: Pull and group reviews mentioning technical issues for a specific title
* Build a SQL query to support a real research request (individualized) and present results
